 The first week of June is the (UK Games Expo)[https://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk/]. For the last three years I have judged the UK Star Trek Attack Wing National Championships. Sometimes these are official this year unfortunately it was not.


 Star Trek Attack Wing Unnationals has never been the busiest game but we had 11 players across the UK, including returning three time national champion Bryan G.
