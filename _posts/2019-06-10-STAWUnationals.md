 The first week of June is the (UK Games Expo)[https://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk/]. For the last three years I have judged the UK Star Trek Attack Wing National Championships. Sometimes these are official this year unfortunately it was not.

 Star Trek Attack Wing Unnationals has never been the busiest game but we had 11 players across the UK, including returning three time national champion Bryan G.

_Note: While watching the videos of this event you may have seen two things that may not appear quite right. This is a friendly tournament where want to test the skill of the players not the players ability to pack. Dan flew two Klingon B'rels that appeared to be permanently cloaked because of breakages on route. Also Byron lost one of his dials after arriving at the show. All players agreed that neither of these problems should stop them from playing._

### Round 1

Every Year I ensure that the first round no one plays someone from their same town. This is so everyone gets a different opponent. The first round drawings were as followed.

## Final Listing

# Special Mentions

### David

David every year makes full use of of his 3d printer and prints a load of tokens and donated a complete set of his token holders for the game. This year I awarded the token holders to Alex for the great dice rolling she did for her dad.

### Byron

Byron arrived with his fleet sheet, including an entire dosier on his ships and his opponents ships, highlighting entry points and week spots. I felt he had done the perfect amount of planning.

### Shug

No one has ever in my history of playing this game had such excitement of being awarded a bye. I was generally shocked by the size of the smile and the jumping for joy. (He needed a cigarette I found out later)
